FEATURE ENGINEERING
==
This repository is created for independent project **MAFS6100C** supervised by _Dr.Chou Hongsong_.

There are one report and three folders in the repository.

`report.pdf` which summarizes all the research outcomes of the project

`Folder 1` contains the `feature engineering.py` file to produce the result generated from Lasso regression for
feature selection. **Note** the _step1_0050.csv_ should be placed manually into the folder for running.

`Folder 2` contains the `plot_R2.py` for plotting the heatmap of different models and the interim results for plotting have
all be created in advance. The only action needed is to run `plot_R2.py` to plot the heatmap of different models.

`Folder 3` contains several files:
* `heatmap.py` which is the code to produce the heatmap of different stocks and training period for linear and ridge models.
* `plot_corr_feature_select.py` which is the code to plot the correlation map for different features.
* All the interim results generated by `FeatureEng.py` are stored in sub-directory `result/`.
* **Note that** all the raw data (_step1\_*.csv_) should be manually stored into the sub-directory `data/`.

In the end, we want to first give many thanks for the meaningful and fruitful tutorials given by _Dr. Chou_.
Meanwhile this repository cannot be created if without the contributions from _Manhua, Enhao, Andrew_ so also big applause to the team.
